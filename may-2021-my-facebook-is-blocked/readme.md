## Facebook bug got my account banned. I found a bunch of bugs along the way
It's been a **month** since my Facebook account has been blocked. I was told it was going to be unblocked within 24 hours.

## What was the bug that got it blocked
I went through FB's reset password workflow using one of my computer and when I tried to log in, I got a surprise.
I just clicked, I didn't get a code since I didn't get an email

# If your facebook account gets blocked, chances are you're not getting it back.
You're not getting your account back because of some bugs, and operational procedures.

Let me step back for one moment, and tell you why I need my account back. It's because I don't have the contact information
of anyone close to me, my cell phone directory is empty. I primarily use Messenger, and memorize the phone numbers of family members.

I use Messenger as the main way to teach people to code. 

## Anyways, here's why you're not getting your facebook account back. 

If your account gets blocked, you would need to go to their portal to inform them that your account has been blocked.
It looks like this.


## How to get your account unblocked (happy path)

## In the happy path and all you have to do is complete the workflow to unblock your account

### Step 1
![image_6483441](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2970265/120050425-29c8e080-bfd2-11eb-9597-d909ee18fbe8.JPG)

### Step 2

### Step 3 
![image_6483441 (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2970265/120050417-26355980-bfd2-11eb-8999-730c1f39d766.JPG)

### Step 4
Wait for someone in operations to unblock your account, prob an external contractor. 


### But you're most likely not gonna see the portal above, and this is what you'll see:

### So since the photo above isn't really helpful you'll prob go to their forum

### That won't work because you'll get stuck in a cyclical workflow
1. You got Step 1.
2. You got Step 2.
3. Instead of going to step 3, you're back at step 1.
4. This is because there is an issue with their cookie/authention/authorization

### Even though your account is blocked, your cell phone will still get notifications
But when you click the notification this is what you'll see

### You'll prob realize that the cyclical workflow is because of the cookie/token for authentication/authorization
So you can prob copy the url and paste it in incognito, or clear you cookies, cache etc.

### You'll prob happy at this point that you're making progress
